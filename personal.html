<p>hello</p>
<p ALIGN=CENTER>
My greatest passions are travel and Techonlogy. I used to read a whole lot of books but that doesn't mean I stopped reading. It just means that now its all on internet. My experience has taught me that science has to be experimented, not just learned.
yeah...I have tried a whole lot of cool stuff which ranges from designing rockets to
cultivating bacterias at home. Being a member of Astronomy club at Regional Science
Centre made me realise the fact that nothing is impossible. We discuss almost everything that fascinates us about Science. Happy that I have friends who help me in all kinds of crazy experiments.

It was then that I joined robotics club at NIT Calicut where the boom of programming languages and electronics hit me. I was able
to learn Arduino and the most awe-inspiring thing called Android Studio. I have developed almost everything that had come to my mind and I'm pretty sure that this will keep me going :)
