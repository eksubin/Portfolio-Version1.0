Prior to that i worked as a Systems Engineer in Robotics and Cognitive Systems group ( TCS ). I did my B.Tech in Biotechnology from National Institute of Technology Calicut. I'm from a small village in Northern Kerala in India. Since my childhood, I have been interested in exploring new technology domains. Designing and experimenting these new domains have become a part of my life. I have worked in various fields like Deep learning, Machine learning, Robotics, Android App Development, Augmented Reality and Microbiology. It is the projects that I have done which has taken me through the different aspects of these fields.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">It was then that I joined robotics club at NIT Calicut where the boom of programming languages and electronics hit me. I was able to learn Arduino and the most awe-inspiring thing called Android Studio.

          <p style="text-align:justify">The DNA Amplifier available in the market always cost more than 1600$, Which makes the experiments with PCR a bit more costly and not available for science guys. Since PCR is the basic step in genetic engineering it is too hard to continue any experiments in biotechnology I have designed a PCR machine under 300$, which can be completely controlled by an android application. This machine runs the basic PCR protocol and replicates the DNA and gives you the same result as the normal PCR machine can give. The whole machine can also be debugged using the android application. The first model of this machine have released into DIY Bio community </p>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Secura is a Double password protected door lock operated by an Android application based on augmented reality. There is no lock and key mechanism in this system, The application identifies the door based on the QR code generated by the user and the keypad becomes visible only when it identifies the QR code. Later the user is prompted to enter the four-digit password on the screen to open the door. This unit allows the user to change both the lock (QR code ) and the password at any time and allows the exchange of locks between doors</p>

The application was inspired by "SPARSH" which was released by MIT Media Lab.  Abhram can transfer images from one android device to other just by your touch. It works based on the Dropbox cloud. The data is temporarily stored in Dropbox and retrieved on the point of next touch on any android based devices. The user has two modes either to transfer data or to receive it.

          <p style="text-align:justify">AR Magic box is an augmented reality-based setup which allows a person to control any physical devices using Augmented reality powered android application. In the video, a Device( Fan ) is been controlled by attaching a marker over it and connecting its power source to AR Magic box. The device allows us to control any devices connected to it without creating any physical changes in it</p>

          <p style="text-align:justify">Normal greeting cards are not meant to hide secrets from everyone. Whoever has the card can read whatever written in it. Here we found the possibility of augmented reality to hide secrets in a greeting card, the person who gets the card have to use our specialized android application to read the secret written in the card. This greeting card is been given during farewell of my seniors in Robotics interest group.</p>

          <p class="mb-0"><strong>Technology </strong>: The Greeting cards contain a marker(The cartoon of a dancing girl) near to the greetings message. This is considered as an image marker and tracked in the video stream of the android application. When the application detects the marker it overlays an image of our secret message.  </p>

          <h2 class="mb-5">Augmented Newspaper</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify">Augmented reality newspaper is an example of how a future newspaper looks like. When the normal newspaper can only give an image of a specific news. The augmented newspaper will be able to play a video that is related to the image in the newspaper. AR newspaper requires our specialized android application which can track and detect the image given in a newspaper and load a video on its position. The given youtube video is about a newsletter I designed on the activities of the robotics club when the user shows his camera over the news the club orientation video will start to play in the position of the image in the newsletter</p>
